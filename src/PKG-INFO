Description: psycopg is a PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming
        language. This is version 2, a complete rewrite of the original code to
        provide new-style classes for connection and cursor objects and other sweet
        candies. Like the original, psycopg 2 was written with the aim of being
        very small and fast, and stable as a rock.
        
        psycopg is different from the other database adapter because it was
        designed for heavily multi-threaded applications that create and destroy
        lots of cursors and make a conspicuous number of concurrent INSERTs or
        UPDATEs. psycopg 2 also provide full asycronous operations for the really
        brave programmer.
