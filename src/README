psycopg2 - Python-PostgreSQL Database Adapter
********************************************

psycopg2 is a PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming
language. This is version 2, a complete rewrite of the original code to
provide new-style classes for connection and cursor objects and other
sweet candies. Like the original, psycopg2 was written with the aim of
being very small and fast, and stable as a rock.

psycopg2 is different from the other database adapter because it was
designed for heavily multi-threaded applications that create and destroy
lots of cursors and make a conspicuous number of concurrent INSERTs or
UPDATEs. psycopg2 also provide full asycronous operations for the really
brave programmer.

There are confirmed reports of psycopg 1.x compiling and running on Linux
and FreeBSD on i386, Solaris, MacOS X and win32 architectures. psycopg2
does not introduce build-wise incompatible changes so it should be able to
compile on all architectures just as its predecessor did.

Now go read the INSTALL file. More information about psycopg2 extensions to
the DBAPI-2.0 is available in the files located in the doc/ direcory.
Example code can be found in the examples/ directory. If you make any changes
to the code make sure to run the unit tests localed in tests/.

psycopg2 is free software ("free as in freedom" but I like beer too.)
It is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or
later plus an exception to allow OpenSSL (libpq) linking; see LICENSE for
more details.

A short list of contributors to psycopg2 follows (if you feel you belong
to this list and you can't find yourself here just drop me a mail):

 * Kudos to piro for all the documentation work.

 * Peter Fein contributed a logging connection/cursor class that even if it
   was not used directly heavily influenced the implementation currently in
   psycopg2.extras.
